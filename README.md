Calculating the famous physics formulae on a graphical user interface

This is a very simple GUI project which gets input by user as values to calculate some famous physics formulae on the screen. We will enter some formulae day by day.

We are currently two persons, my son and me.

I expect my son kagazi will create calculating functions and I will concentrate on the GUI.

Good luck to us, everybody is welcome for this very difficult project :)
